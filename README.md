## REACT HOOKS STOPWATCH

A simple React Hooks experment taken from Kent C Dodds [Egghead.io](https://t.co/c405oeds1D) React Hooks & Supsense playlist.

I've added babel, webpack, css-loader, babel-loader, & webpack-dev-server.

1. Install dependencies
2. run webpack-dev-server with npm run start script

```
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```
